## Features
- Hosting for Minecraft servers, Discord bots, APIs, and web servers.

## Installation

## Usage
This documentation provides scripts that users can download, adapt to their own server, and run. The repository is aimed at users with limited knowledge.

## Contributing

## Roadmap
A Kanban board will be maintained with tasks and goals for future development.
